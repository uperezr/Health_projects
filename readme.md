## Collaborative Project: Udacity & Bertelsmann Data Science Challenge Scholarship

Classification of Genetic Risk for Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia. See the project showcase.

Hypothesis:
Being older is not associated with a higher risk level, it is genetics-related.
Translocation t(8;21) is the most frequent cause of low risk.
FLT3 mutation is the most responsible cause for high risk (age > 10 years old in the references).
